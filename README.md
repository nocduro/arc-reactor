Code to run 15 WS2812b's with a microphone and a switch

Note: This was one of my first personal programming projects so it's quite rough around the edges. Mostly kept up as it's an easy place
to store the code since it is referenced in this post on my website: https://nocduro.ca/finished-projects/arc-reactor
